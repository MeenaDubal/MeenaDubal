ML Project: 

Project using Python and ML A retail chain with numerous outlets nationwide is encountering challenges in effectively managing inventory to align demand with supply. The provided dataset includes weekly sales data for various outlets. The task involves utilizing statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and outlier analysis to address missing values and derive insights. Additionally, predictive modeling techniques will be employed to forecast sales for each store over the next 12 weeks. This comprehensive approach aims to provide valuable perspectives for improved inventory management and sales predictions.
